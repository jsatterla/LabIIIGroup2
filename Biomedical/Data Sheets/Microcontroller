Ultimately, the g2553 may not have been the best choice for this project. Theoretically, the adc is more than capable of operating at the necessary speed.
While I still believe this is true, and the slower readings from the EKG machine are not the msp's fault, I cannot rule that out as a possibility.
If the project was to be attempted again, a faster "overkill" type microcontroller would be used just to isolate the error to being completely on the software side.
