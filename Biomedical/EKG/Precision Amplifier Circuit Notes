A low noise, high precision amplifier is needed to increase the small signals to a readable level without introducing too much noise into the system.

The AD624 amplifier was used (datasheet in references) which causes the peak wave of the EKG (QRS Complex) to be amplified to approximately a 1 volt spike.

The filtering worked well, with the higher frequency noise being removed efficiently and the low signal being left untouched to be read by the MSP430's ADC.

With only two leads being used in this circuit, it is not difficult to catch the QRS complex, and the T wave can be found with some difficulty. It is unlikely to be able to catch the P wave or the downward deflection of the graph without adding more leads, though for the purposes of prototyping and demonstration of this project more leads will not be added.
